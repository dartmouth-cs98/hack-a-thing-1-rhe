For this hack-a-thing, I decided to try out Swift. Previously, I had used XCode but only in the context of React Native. To familiarize myself, I followed a Swift tutorial that I found online that involved making a simple Add 1 game (https://learnappmaking.com/creating-a-simple-ios-game-with-swift-in-xcode/#whats-the-add-1-game). 

I really enjoyed using Swift and Storyboard. Previously, I had limited experience with Android Studio and Java programming and was shocked at the ability to drag and drop. However, XCode, Swift and Storyboard presented a UI that was even more convenient and intuitive than Android Studio. Compared to React and React Native, I feel that the dev experience is more user friendly and beginner friendly, with the main differentiator being that there is no drag-and-drog or high-level commands you can do in the IDE to modify styling, components or code in React but you can do so in Swift and XCode. 

While doing the tutorial, I did encoutner a syntax error that prevented my project from building. It turns out that the error was because I was running an older version of XCode that didn't support updated syntax so I had to update my MacOS and my XCode version in order for it to run as expected.
